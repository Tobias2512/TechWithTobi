This is my personal website with some of my projects I liked working on.
I never learned web development so I wanted to learn this by just making
a website and looking everything up as I go on. This way I learned very
much about: CSS, JavaScript and HTMl. To handle the backend of my website,
I used a flask app which you can see in app.py.
